Hello! Welcome to the fourth part of the CSE15l journey!! 

We will completing the next steps and documenting them below. The steps include

1. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
2. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
3. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
4. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
5. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

## 1. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

To do this type 
```
git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7
```

in your terminal and click 
```
<enter>
```
then to run the test type
```
bash test.sh
```
in the terminal and click

## 3. Edit the code file to fix the failing test

```
and then click
